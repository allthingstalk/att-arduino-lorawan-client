/**
  a data object that contains all the instrumentation data of the modem.
  Use this to get information about the following modem parameters:
  
  - Modem (number): the id of the modem. 
    values: 
      - 0: unknown
      - 1: multitech mdot
      - 2: embit-EMB-LR1272(E)
      - 3: microchip RN2483
  - data rate (number): The speed by which the modem sends and receives data. The following data rates are available: 7.8 kHz; 10.4 kHz; 15.6 kHz; 20.8 kHz; 31.2 kHz; 41.7 kHz; 62.5 kHz; 125 kHz; 250 kHz; 500 kHz. The required bandwidth can be selected according to the data requirements as well as the link conditions.
  - power index (integer): or output power: the power that the modem uses for radio communication, expressed in dBm
  - adr: Indicates if adaptive data rate is used or not (the gateway determines the speed of the modem)
  - duty cycle (integer): Duty cycle is the ratio between transmission time versus wait or receive time
  - nr of gateways (integer): The number of gateways that successfully received the last link check request frame command.
  - SNR (integer, between -128 and 127):  The signal to noise ration of the last received packet
  - retransmission count (integer):  nr of times that the modem needed to retry the last transmission.
  - bandwitdh (integer): the bandwith being used by the modem.
    values: 
      - 0: unknown
      - 1: 125
      - 2: 250
      - 3: 500
  - coding rate (integer): In telecommunication and information theory, the code rate (or information rate[1]) of a forward error correction code is the proportion of the data-stream that is useful (non-redundant). That is, if the code rate is k/n, for every k bits of useful information, the coder generates totally n bits of data, of which n-k are redundant.
    values:
      - 0: 4/5
      - 1: 4/6
      - 2: 4/7
      - 3: 4/8
  - frequency band (integer): The frequency band represents the moduleâ€™s operation types (region)
    values:
      - 0: 433
      - 1: 868
  - spreading factor (integer) 
    values:
      - 0: unknown
      - 1: sf 7
      - 2: sf 8
      - 3: sf 9
      - 4: sf 10
      - 5: sf 11
      - 6: sf 12
